### :pushpin: Projects : 

In the present cirumstances all projects within my repositories are Data Science related ranging from **Data Analysis** to implementing **Deep Learning Neural Networks Modelling**. Here also lies the projects and works from the previous Data Science Bootcamp at Hacktiv8. Here are the repo's that you want to look at :
- <a href="https://github.com/innoefawwaz/Data-Science-Projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data-Science-Projects</a> : In this repository you'll find various of Data Science related projects. Here you can see that i did some things such as Exploratory Data Analysis, used a supervised & unsupervised machine learning by using regression and classification, aswell as implementing deep learning on classification and Natural Language Processing tasks.

## Closing Statement

As the mighty **Benjamin Franklin** said : *"Without Continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning."* I am eager to keep growing as a Data Scientist and person, hopefully making impact on the surroundings in the journey of our success. Thank you for stopping by, and **never keep stop learning!**
